<P class="text">The <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> is my shepherd; I shall 
not want. He maketh me to lie down in green pastures: he leadeth me beside the 
still waters. He restoreth my soul: he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness 
for his name's sake. Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of 
death, I will fear no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they 
comfort me. Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies: 
thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over. Surely goodness and mercy 
shall follow me all the days of my life: and I will dwell in the house of the
<span class="small-caps">Lord</span> for ever.</P>
